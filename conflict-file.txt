Good afternoon everyone Today I want to talk to you about a seemingly mundane experience that we all share the experience of waiting in line at the grocery store.
Now you may wonder how a simple act like this can hold any deeper meaning. But I believe it can teach us valuable lessons about patience, resilience and the beauty of the human connection.
Picture this. You stand in line, surrounded by others. Some are scrolling through their phones, others are lost in thought, and a few are chatting with those around them.
In this moment of waiting we have a unique opportunity to reflect. We can take a step back from our busy lives, breathe, and think about what truly matters. 
Waiting is often seen as a waste of time but I challenge you to see it differently. Each second spent in that line is a moment for gratitude. 
It is a moment to appreciate the food we have access to, the community we are part of, and the simple act of being alive. 
In our fast-paced world we often rush from one task to another, but in those moments of waiting we can find clarity.
Moreover waiting in line can remind us of our shared humanity. We are all in this together, each person with their own story, their own struggles, and their own dreams. 
A smile or a kind word exchanged can brighten someoneâ€™s day. Let us embrace these moments to reach out and connect rather than retreat into our own worlds.
So the next time you find yourself in line at the grocery store remember this. It is not just a wait it is an opportunity.
An opportunity to reflect, connect and grow. Thank you.
